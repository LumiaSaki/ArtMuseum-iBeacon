Art Museum with iBeacon
===================================
~~This is a very simple demo for broadcasting & detecting ibeacon device.~~
~~In the 'iBeaconDemo' project folder, the broadcasting app is implemented, and in the 'iBeaconReceiverDemo' folder, the detecting app is implemented.~~

~~Only for learning how to build a very beginning iBeacon.~~

With this application, you can receive the relevant information at the time you are close to the exhibits.

It can partially replace the role of tour guide who works at museum.

USAGE
===================================
Just install 'iBeaconReceiveDemo' on your iPhone.

ISSUES
===================================
'iBeaconDemo' is a advertising application, it can make an iOS device as a iBeacon.
Apple has made some changes in iOS8 SDK, this advertising app doesn't work on iOS 8.
